# About Me
I am a PhD student at Michigan State University, studying computational
mathematics. My main motivation is to develop numerical software for solving
cutting-edge scientific problems. My biggest project as a PhD student has been
devloping [QuantumGateDesign.jl](https://github.com/leespen1/QuantumGateDesign.jl),
an open-source Julia package that solves quantum optimal control problems (e.g.
shaping control pulses to implement quantum logic gates) quickly by using a
high-order Hermite method and a continuous control pulse model.

In general, my interests include applying numerical methods to problems in
science and industry, writing scientific software, making cool visualizations,
and good pedagogy.
