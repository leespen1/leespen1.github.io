## QuantumGateDesign.jl

[QuantumGateDesign.jl](https://github.com/leespen1/QuantumGateDesign.jl) is an
open-source Julia package which quickly solves quantum optimal control problems
using a novel, high-order numerical method based on Hermite interpolation. You
can read about the method in our
[publication in Journal of Computational Physics](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2026.114697)
(or in the
[arXiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09857)).

I presented a
[hands-on tutorial](https://github.com/leespen1/SIAMQuantumGateDesignTutorial/blob/main/SIAM_Tutorial.ipynb)
on QuantumGateDesign.jl at the
[SIAM Annual Meeting 2025](https://www.siam.org/conferences-events/siam-conferences/an25/),
which walks through setting up and solving quantum optimal control problems
using the package.
