As part of a working group during the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics' 
[long workshop on non-commutative optimal transport](https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/long-programs/non-commutative-optimal-transport/),
I gave a 1 hour talk introducing the basic ideas of quantum optimal control.
I also made a short handout to accompany the talk. I wrote the handout to be
accessible to people without much background in quantum computing or optimal
control.
